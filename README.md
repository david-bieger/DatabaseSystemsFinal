# DatabaseSystemsFinal
Final Project Database Systems


http://localhost/cs4750/DatabaseSystemsFinal/login.php

Things left to do:
Make the buttons for accepting/rejecting friend requests
Make the form for submitting friend requests work
Make a validator for whether a friendship exists that stops people from submitting a request if they're already friends or already have an active request
for friends, search more than just 1 to 2 relationship (i.e 2 to 1 relationship as well)
Show pending requests and be able to accept them for friends.
add body weight history section (with graph? if we can figure that out)
fix my profile to show maxes and such (and allow them to be changed)
